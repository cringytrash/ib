= How to Start / Troubleshooting =
Make sure to extract the .zip file first.
Then run "StartWindowed" to play in a window, or "StartFullscreen" to play in fullscreen.

When reading a certain storybook, you may get the error "No such interface supported."
A video is supposed to play at that point, but it may not work for some.
Switching to windowed mode may help, and you can also try updating your video codecs.
If it still won't work, you can skip watching the video by choosing the other dialogue option.
The video that is meant to play can be found in the Movie folder and watched externally.
